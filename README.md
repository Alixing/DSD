## DSD Model Zoo

This repo contains pre-trained models by Dense-Sparse-Dense(DSD) training on Imagenet.

Compared to conventional training method, dense→sparse→dense (DSD) training yielded higher
accuracy with same model architecture.

Sparsity is a powerful form of regularization. Our intuition is that, once the network arrives at a
local minimum given the sparsity constraint, relaxing the constraint gives the network more
freedom to escape the saddle point and arrive at a higher-accuracy local minimum.

Feel free to use the better-accuracy DSD models to help your research.
